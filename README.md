# Self-supervised-video-De-blurring
Motion is blur is a major factor that degrades the image quality .It arises due to rapid change in image content hence necessitating longer exposure times.  The existing techniques to address the challenge are divided into 2 categories: First approach is optimization based approach which suffer from high complexity of computation which limits their application in time-restricted environment. Second approach considers the deblurring task as learning problem with the help of convolution neural networks(CNN) state-of-the-art results are obtained but obtaining both blur and sharp image pairs are not easy as not every camera has high fps that can be used to train the data and another reason is the obtaining quality in real scenarios is difficult where the real motion blur occurs , so a novel self-supervised approach is needed which only relies on real-world blurry image frame sequences for training which helps in improving the networks generalization performance.
